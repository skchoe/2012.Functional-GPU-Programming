		Pointer to the input array where the data is stored. The input values

	\param hist
		Pointer to the output array where the computed histogram is to be stored.
		Output array must be allocated and freed by the caller.
	\param length
		Number of the input array's elements.
	\param bins
		Number of the histogram bins or output array's elements.
	\param p_options
		A structure which defines the execution configuration.
	\param device
		A flag which indicates whether input/output arrays are allocated on the
		host (CPU) memory or the device (GPU) memory.

	\remark
        When the function is being called inside a loop or multiple times, for
        best performance allocate the input and ouput arrays on device memory to
        avoid unnecessary allocation, memory transfers and deallocation by the
        function.
	\remark
		When \a device flag is set, the caller needs to allocate memory for \a 
		hist but does not need to initialize the array. The initialization will 
		be done by the function itself.
	\remark
		Input data must be normalized between 0 and 1. The behavior of the function
		for values outside this range is undefined and is most likely to cause 
		memory corruption.
