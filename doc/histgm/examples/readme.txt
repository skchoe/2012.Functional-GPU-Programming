The source code is written and built with Visual Studio 8 (2005) and has been tested on nVidia 8800GTX.

In order to compile:
-You need Windows (my apologies to Mac and Linux fans!)
-You need a CUDA compatible nVidia card (8 series or above) 
-Install nVidia CUDA SDK and Toolkit (visit http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html)
-Make sure that cutil.dll (part of the toolkit) is found the path, by default this file can be found at
c:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA CUDA SDK\common\lib\
