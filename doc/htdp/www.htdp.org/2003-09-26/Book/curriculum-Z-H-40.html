<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_171">91</a> recalls the structure and data
definitions of family trees from section&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-19.html#node_sec_14.1">14.1</a> where
we developed the function <code class=scheme><span class=variable>blue-eyed-ancestor?</span></code>, which determined
whether an ancestor family tree contained a blue-eyed family member. In
contrast, <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-blue-eyed-ancestors</span></code>, the function in
figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_171">91</a>, collects the names of all blue-eyed
family in a given family tree.</p>
<p>
The function's structure is that of a tree-processing function.  It has two
cases: one for the empty tree and another one for a <code class=scheme><span class=variable>child</span></code>
node. The latter clause contains two self-references: one per parent. These
recursive applications collect the names of all blue-eyed ancestors from
the father's and the mother's family tree; <code class=scheme><span class=builtin>append</span></code> combines the two
lists into one.</p>
<p>
The <code class=scheme><span class=builtin>append</span></code> function is a structurally recursive function. Here it
processes the two lists that the natural recursions of
<code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-blue-eyed-ancestors</span></code> produce. According to
section&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-22.html#node_sec_17.1">17.1</a>, this observation suggests that the
function is a natural candidate for a transformation into
accumulator-style. </p>
<p>
Let's get started: 
<a name="node_idx_2030"></a></p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme><span class=comment>;; <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-blue-eyed-ancestors</span> <span class=selfeval>:</span> <span class=variable>ftn</span> &nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp; (<span class=keyword>listof</span> <span class=variable>symbol</span>)</code></span>

          (<span class=keyword>define</span> (<span class=variable>all-a</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span> <span class=variable>accumulator</span>)
            (<span class=keyword>cond</span>
              [(<span class=builtin>empty?</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) ...]
              [<span class=keyword>else</span> 
               (<span class=keyword>local</span> ((<span class=keyword>define</span> <span class=variable>in-parents</span> 
                         (<span class=variable>all-a</span> ... (<span class=builtin>child-father</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) ... 
			        ... <span class=variable>accumulator</span> ...)
                         (<span class=variable>all-a</span> ... (<span class=builtin>child-mother</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) ...
			        ... <span class=variable>accumulator</span> ...)))
                 (<span class=keyword>cond</span>
                   [(<span class=builtin>symbol=?</span> (<span class=builtin>child-eyes</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=keyword>'</span><span class=variable>blue</span>) 
                    (<span class=builtin>cons</span> (<span class=builtin>child-name</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=variable>in-parents</span>)]
                   [<span class=keyword>else</span> <span class=variable>in-parents</span>]))])))
    (<span class=variable>all-a</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree0</span> ...)))
</pre></div><p></p>
<p>
Our next goal is the formulation of an accumulator invariant. The general
purpose of the accumulator is to remember knowledge about <code class=scheme><span class=variable>a-ftree0</span></code>
that <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> loses as it traverses the tree.  A look at the
definition in figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_171">91</a> shows two recursive
applications. The first one processes <code class=scheme>(<span class=builtin>child-father</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>)</code>,
which means this application of <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-blue-eyed-ancestors</span></code> loses
knowledge about the mother of <code class=scheme><span class=variable>a-ftree</span></code>. Conversely, the second
recursive application has no knowledge of the father of <code class=scheme><span class=variable>a-ftree</span></code> as
it processes the mother's family tree.</p>
<p>
At this point, we have two choices: 
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The accumulator could represent all blue-eyed ancestors encountered
so far, including those in the mother's family tree, as it descends into
the father's tree. </p>
<p>
</p>
<li><p>The alternative is to have the accumulator stand for the lost items
in the tree. That is, as <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> processes the father's family tree,
it remembers the mother's tree in the accumulator (and everything else it
hasn't seen before). 
</p>
</ol><p>
Let's explore both possibilities, starting with the first.</p>
<p>
Initially, <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> has not seen any of the nodes in the family tree,
so <code class=scheme><span class=variable>accumulator</span></code> is <code class=scheme><span class=builtin>empty</span></code>. As <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> is about to
traverse the father's family tree, we must create a list that represents
all blue-eyed ancestors in the tree that we are about to forget, which is
the mother's tree. This suggests the following accumulator invariant
formulation: 
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme><span class=comment>;; <code class=scheme><span class=variable>accumulator</span></code> is the list of blue-eyed ancestors</span>
<span class=comment>;; encountered on the mother-side trees of the path in</span>
<span class=comment>;; <code class=scheme><span class=variable>a-ftree0</span></code> to <code class=scheme><span class=variable>a-ftree</span></code></span>
</pre></div><p></p>
<p>
To maintain the invariant for the natural recursion, we must collect the
ancestors on the mother's side of the tree. Since the purpose of
<code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> is to collect those ancestors, we use the expression 
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme>(<span class=variable>all-a</span> (<span class=builtin>child-mother</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=variable>accumulator</span>)
</pre></div><p>
to compute the new accumulator for the application of <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> to
<code class=scheme>(<span class=builtin>child-father</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>)</code>. Putting everything together for the second
<code class=scheme><span class=keyword>cond</span></code>-clause yields this:
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme>(<span class=keyword>local</span> ((<span class=keyword>define</span> <span class=variable>in-parents</span> 
	  (<span class=variable>all-a</span> (<span class=builtin>child-father</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>)
	    (<span class=variable>all-a</span> (<span class=builtin>child-mother</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>)
	      <span class=variable>accumulator</span>))))
  (<span class=keyword>cond</span>
    [(<span class=builtin>symbol=?</span> (<span class=builtin>child-eyes</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=keyword>'</span><span class=variable>blue</span>) 
     (<span class=builtin>cons</span> (<span class=builtin>child-name</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=variable>in-parents</span>)]
    [<span class=keyword>else</span> <span class=variable>in-parents</span>]))
</pre></div><p>
This leaves us with the answer in the first <code class=scheme><span class=keyword>cond</span></code>-clause.  Since
<code class=scheme><span class=variable>accumulator</span></code> represents all blue-eyed ancestors encountered so far,
it is the result. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_172">92</a> contains the complete
definition.</p>

<p>
For the second version, we want the accumulator to represent a list of all
of the family trees that haven't been processed yet. Because of the
different intention, let us call the accumulator parameter <code class=scheme><span class=variable>todo</span></code>:
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme><span class=comment>;; <code class=scheme><span class=variable>todo</span></code> is the list of family trees </span>
<span class=comment>;; encountered but not processed </span>
</pre></div><p>
Like the accumulator-style <code class=scheme><span class=variable>invert</span></code>, <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> initializes
<code class=scheme><span class=variable>todo</span></code> to <code class=scheme><span class=builtin>empty</span></code>. It updates it by extending the list for
the natural recursion:
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme>(<span class=keyword>local</span> ((<span class=keyword>define</span> <span class=variable>in-parents</span> 
	  (<span class=variable>all-a</span> (<span class=builtin>child-father</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) 
	    (<span class=builtin>cons</span> (<span class=builtin>child-mother</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=variable>todo</span>))))
  (<span class=keyword>cond</span>
    [(<span class=builtin>symbol=?</span> (<span class=builtin>child-eyes</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=keyword>'</span><span class=variable>blue</span>) 
     (<span class=builtin>cons</span> (<span class=builtin>child-name</span> <span class=variable>a-ftree</span>) <span class=variable>in-parents</span>)]
    [<span class=keyword>else</span> <span class=variable>in-parents</span>]))
</pre></div><p></p>
<p>
The problem now is that when <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> is applied to the
<code class=scheme><span class=builtin>empty</span></code> tree, <code class=scheme><span class=variable>todo</span></code> does not represent the result but what
is left to do for <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code>. To visit all those family trees,
<code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> must be applied to them, one at a time. Of course, if
<code class=scheme><span class=variable>todo</span></code> is <code class=scheme><span class=builtin>empty</span></code>, there is nothing left to do; the result is
<code class=scheme><span class=builtin>empty</span></code>. If <code class=scheme><span class=variable>todo</span></code> is a list, we pick the first tree on the
list as the next one to be processed: 
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme>(<span class=keyword>cond</span>
  [(<span class=builtin>empty?</span> <span class=variable>todo</span>) <span class=builtin>empty</span>]
  [<span class=keyword>else</span> (<span class=variable>all-a</span> (<span class=builtin>first</span> <span class=variable>todo</span>) (<span class=builtin>rest</span> <span class=variable>todo</span>))])
</pre></div><p>
The rest of the list is what is now left to do. </p>

Figure&nbsp;<a href="#node_fig_Temp_173">93</a> contains the complete definition for this
second accumulator-style variant of <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-blue-eyed-ancestors</span></code>. The
auxiliary definition is the most unusual recursive function definition we
have seen.  It contains a recursive application of <code class=scheme><span class=variable>all-a</span></code> in both
the first and the second <code class=scheme><span class=keyword>cond</span></code>-clause. That is, the function
definition does not match the data definition for family trees, the primary
inputs.  While a function like that can be the result of a careful chain of
development steps, starting from a working function developed with a design
recipe, it should never be a starting point. </p>
<p>
The use of accumulators is also fairly common in programs that process
representations of programs. We encountered these forms of data in
section&nbsp;<a href="curriculum-Z-H-19.html#node_sec_14.4">14.4</a>, and like family trees, they have complicated
data definitions. In intermezzo&nbsp;3, we also discussed some concepts
concerning variables and their mutual association, though without
processing these concepts. The following exercises introduce simple
functions that work with the scope of parameters, binding occurrences of
variables, and other notions. </p>

<b>Exercise 32.1.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Develop a data representation for the following tiny subset of 
Scheme expressions: 
</p>
<div align=center><table><tr><td>

<table border=0><tr><td valign=top ><tt>&lt;exp&gt;</tt> 
</td><td valign=top >=</td><td valign=top ><tt>&lt;var&gt;</tt> 
 |  (<strong>lambda</strong> (<tt>&lt;var&gt;</tt>) <tt>&lt;exp&gt;</tt>)
 |  (<tt>&lt;exp&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;exp&gt;</tt>)
</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table></div>

The subset contains only three kinds of expressions: variables, functions
of one argument, and function applications. <p>
Examples: 
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme><span class=variable>1.</span> (<span class=keyword>lambda</span> (<span class=variable>x</span>) <span class=variable>y</span>)

      (<span class=keyword>lambda</span> (<span class=variable>x</span>) <span class=variable>x</span>))

<span class=variable>3.</span> (((<span class=keyword>lambda</span> (<span class=variable>y</span>)
	 (<span class=keyword>lambda</span> (<span class=variable>x</span>)
	   <span class=variable>y</span>))
       (<span class=keyword>lambda</span> (<span class=variable>z</span>) <span class=variable>z</span>))
      (<span class=keyword>lambda</span> (<span class=variable>w</span>) <span class=variable>w</span>))
</pre></div><p>        
Represent variables as symbols. Call the class of data
<i>Lam</i>.
<a name="node_idx_2034"></a></p>
<p>
Recall that <strong>lambda</strong>-expressions are functions without names. Thus they bind their
parameter in the body. In other words, the scope of a <strong>lambda</strong>-expression's parameter
is the body. Explain the scope of each binding occurrence in the above
examples. Draw arrows from all bound occurrences to the binding
occurrences.</p>
<p>
If a variable occurs in an expression but has no corresponding binding
occurrence, the occurrence is said to be free.  Make up an expression in
which <code class=scheme><span class=variable>x</span></code> occurs both free and bound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">

<h2><a href="curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_32.2">32.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Exercise: Missionaries and Cannibals</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>


</p>
<p>
On occasion, accumulators are a part of a piece of compound data because a
function manages many pieces of data (in the same class) at the same time.
The following story poses just such a problem:
</p>
<blockquote>
Once upon a time, three cannibals were guiding three missionaries through a
jungle. They were on their way to the nearest mission station. After some
time, they arrived at a wide river, filled with deadly snakes and
fish. There was no way to cross the river without a boat. Fortunately,
they found a row boat with two oars after a short search. Unfortunately,
the boat was too small to carry all of them. It could barely carry two
people at a time.  Worse, because of the river's width there was no way to
bring the boat back other than to row it back.<p>
Since the missionaries could not trust the cannibals they had to figure out
a plan to get all six of them safely across the river. The problem was
that these cannibals would kill and eat missionaries as soon as there were
more cannibals than missionaries at some place. Thus our
missionary-programmer had to devise a plan that guaranteed that there were
never any missionaries in the minority at either side of the river.  The
cannibals, however, can be trusted to cooperate otherwise. Specifically,
they won't abandon any potential food, just as the missionaries won't
abandon any potential converts.</p>
<p>
Luckily one of the missionaries had taken a Scheme course and knew how to
solve this problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
While we can solve the problem by hand, solving it with a Scheme function is
more fun and more general. If the same story comes up again with different
numbers of cannibals and missionaries or different boat sizes, we can use
the same function to solve the problem again.<p>
As with every problem, we begin by laying out how to represent the problem
in our data language and then study how to represent certain actions in the
real world in our programming language. 
<a name="node_idx_2036"></a>Here are two basic constants concerning the data representation: 
</p>
<div align=left><pre class=scheme>(<span class=keyword>define</span> <span class=variable>MC</span> <span class=selfeval>3</span>)
(<span class=keyword>define</span> <span class=variable>BOAT-CAPACITY</span> <span class=selfeval>2</span>)
</pre></div><p>
Formulate the function in terms of these constants. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="node_thm_32.2.1"></a>
<b>Exercise 32.2.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Provide a data representation for the states of a river crossing.  A
state should record the number of missionaries and cannibals on each side
of the river and the location of the boat.  Here is a graphical
representation of the states: <br>

</p>

<center><img src=../icons/mc-a.gif></img></center>

The two lines represent the river, the black and white dots the
missionaries and cannibals, the black rectangle the boat. Determine the
initial and final state of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">

<b>Exercise 32.2.2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Develop a data representation for boat loads. Define <code class=scheme><span class=variable>BOAT-LOADS</span></code>,
the list of all possible boat loads. </p>
<p>
Develop the function <code class=scheme><span class=variable>make-BOAT-LOADS</span></code>, which consumes the boat's maximal
capacity and constructs the list of possible boat loads.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">
&nbsp;<a href="../Solutions/mc-boatload.html">Solution</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>
One way to deal with search problems in a systematic manner is to generate
all possible successor states for the states we have reached so far, to
filter out the interesting ones, and to start the search over from those.
A successor state is reached by using a feasible transition, for example,
an enabled move in a game, a boat trip, etc. </p>
<p>
Here is a graphical illustration of the situation for our problem:

</p>

<center><img src=../icons/mc-b.gif></img></center>
<p>
The initial state in the top row has five possible successor states, one
per feasible boat load. They are shown in the second row. Two of these
successor states are illegal, because one side contains more cannibals than
missionaries. One of the legal ones is the state in which one missionary
and cannibal reached the right side of the river; it has three successor
states in turn. The following exercises deal with generating the successor
states and filtering out the interesting ones. </p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong>:  Formulate all tests as boolean-valued expressions that
produce <code class=scheme><span class=builtin>true</span></code> if the expected value is the computed one, and

The functions we have developed can generate the successor states of a list

legal.  Now we can develop a function that determines whether we can
transport the missionaries and cannibals across the river.</p>

solution but a list of river crossings if a given missionary-and-cannibal
problem is solvable.</p>
<p>
<strong>Hint:</strong>  Modify the state representations so that they accumulate the list of
crossings that got the group to this particular state. For the initial
state, this is just the empty list; for a final state, it is the desired
solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../icons/hand.right.gif">

<b>Exercise 32.2.8.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
A series of boat trips may bring the group of missionaries and cannibals
back to the initial state (or some other previous state). The series may
include two, four, or more boat trips. In short, the ``game'' contains
cycles.  Make up an example.</p>
<p>
The function <code class=scheme><span class=variable>mc-solution</span></code> generates all those states reachable with,
say, seven boat trips before it generates all those states reachable with
eight crossings. Therefore we do not have to worry about cycles in
solution attempts. Why?  </p>
<p>
Modify the solution so that a state reached via a cycle is also illegal. </p>

<h2><a href="curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_32.3">32.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Exercise: Board Solitaire</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>






</p>
<p>
Peg Solitaire is a board game for individuals.  The board comes in various
shapes. Here is the simplest one:
</p>
<div align=center><table><tr><td>

<img src="curriculum5-Z-G-6.gif" border="0" alt="[curriculum5-Z-G-6.gif]">
</td></tr></table></div>

The circle without a black dot represents an unoccupied hole; the other
circles are holes containing little pegs.<p>
The goal of the game is to eliminate the pegs one by one, until only one
peg is left. A player can eliminate a peg if one of the neighboring holes
is unoccupied and if there is a peg in the hole in the opposite
direction. In that case, the second peg can jump over the first one and the
first one is eliminated. Consider the following configuration: 
</p>
<div align=center><table><tr><td>

<img src="curriculum5-Z-G-7.gif" border="0" alt="[curriculum5-Z-G-7.gif]">
</td></tr></table></div>

Here the pegs labeled&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 could jump. If the player decides to move the
peg labeled&nbsp;2, the next configuration is
<div align=center><table><tr><td>

<img src="curriculum5-Z-G-8.gif" border="0" alt="[curriculum5-Z-G-8.gif]"> </td></tr></table></div>
<p>
Some configurations are dead-ends. For a simple example, consider the first
board configuration. Its hole is in the middle of the board. Hence no peg
can jump, because there are no two pegs in a row, column, or diagonal such
that one can jump over the other into the hole. A player who discovers a
dead-end configuration must stop or backtrack by undoing moves and trying
alternatives.</p>
