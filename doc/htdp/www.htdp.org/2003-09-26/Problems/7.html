<p>
Use the following data and structure definitions to solve
this problem.
</p>
A Document-summary is one of<br />
<code>
<ul>
  <li>(make-letter Symbol Symbol Symbol)</li>
  <li>(make-memo Symbol Symbol Symbol Symbol)</li>
  <li>(make-resume Symbol Symbol Boolean)</li>
</ul>
</code>
<p>where</p>
<code>
(define-struct letter (to date signature))<br />
(define-struct memo (from to date subject))<br />
(define-struct resume (name date sent?))<br />
</code>
<p>
Develop the function <em>from</em>, which consumes a Document-summary
and produces a symbol representing the author of the document (use
the <code>signature</code> property of a letter, 
the <code>from</code> property of a memo, and
the <code>name</code> property of the resume).

Develop data and structure definitions for a collection of 3D shapes.
The collection includes
<ul>
  <li> <b>cubes</b> whose relevant property is the length of an edge;</li>
  <li> <b>prisms</b> which are rectangular solids and whose relevant
       properties are length, width, and height;</li>
  <li> <b>spheres</b> whose relevant property is the radius.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Develop the function <em>volume</em>.
The function consumes a 3D shape and produces the volume of the object.
</p>
<p>
The volume of a cube is the cube of the length of one of its edges.
The volume of a prism is the product of its length, width, and height.
The volume of a sphere is 4/3 * PI * <em>r</em><sup>3</sup>.

Develop data and structure definitions for trains. A train is one of
<ul>
  <li> <b>commuter</b>, which has the properties: number of cars,
       number of passengers per car, and a boolean determing whether
       this particular train makes all stops;
  </li>
  <li> <b>amtrak</b>, which has the properties: number of cars,
       number of passengers per car, and a symbol designating
       the type of train as 'Express, 'Local, or 'Limited;
  </li>
  <li> <b>subway</b>, which has the properties: number of cars,
       number of passengers per car, and a symbol representing the
       color of the train.
  </li>
</ul>
Develop the function <em>hold-all?</em> that, given a train
and a number of passengers, produces <code>true</code> if the train could
contain them all and <code>false</code> if not.

Develop data and structure definitions for school employees.
An employee is one of
<ul>
  <li> <b>principal</b> with properties of monthly salary, office
       number, and a symbol represting the diploma or degree earned by
       the principal;
  </li>
  <li> <b>teacher</b> with properties of monthly salary, room number,
       and a symbol represting the diploma or degree earned by
       the teacher;</li>
  <li> <b>assistant</b> with properties of hourly wage and number of hours
       worked within a pay period.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The payroll office needs to compute various taxes before printing a
paycheck.
Develop the function <em>tax</em>, which takes an employee structure
and a tax rate and returns the amount of tax for the pay period
(per month for principals and teachers and the hours 
worked for an assistant).

Develop data and structure definitions for financial accounts.
An account is one of
<ul>
  <li><b>checking</b> with two properties: balance and number of transactions;
  </li>
  <li><b>savings</b> with two properties: balance and number of transactions;
  </li>
  <li><b>credit</b> with three properties: balance, 
  spending limit, and number of transactions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Develop a data definition for a response.
A response is either 'Error or an account.
</p>
<p>
Develop the function <em>withdrawal</em>, which consumes an account
and an amount and produces a response. In the case in which a
withdrawal would cause the balance of a savings account to go below
zero, 'Error would be produced. Otherwise a new savings account would
be produced with a new balance and the number of transactions
incremented by one. A checking account has overdraft protection up to
$1000, so a withdrawal would signal 'Error if the balance were lower
than $-1000. A credit account's balance increases upon withdrawal, but
cannot go beyond the spending limit.
