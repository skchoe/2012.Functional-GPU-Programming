Goal of document:

This document is written for sumbmitting a writing sample in applying job at
attask.com which is company that produces project management software here at
thanksgiving point, Utah. 

I decided to write a small essay I feel fun while working GPU based set based
static analysis because doing the project is still vivid experience up to now
and the field is fresh to me and drives me to ask question from the scratch.

SBA: Set based analysis of computer program.

This is a technique in programming language and compiler that analize the
behavior of program so that the result of analysis help programmer to ensure
the solving the problem by the program is achived in right way before the
program is converted into machine code and spening so much time for running to
produce output.

So the natural question is "Is static analysis helps to find bug faster than
running the machine code and comimg across the error during run time?". The
answer is no unless the cost of analysis is same as evaluation in actual
running the code.
