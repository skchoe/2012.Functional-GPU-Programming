/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _BSD_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and 4.3BSD things.
   _SVID_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and SVID things.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _REENTRANT		Select additionally reentrant object.
   _THREAD_SAFE		Same as _REENTRANT, often used by other systems.
   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	If set to numeric value > 0 additional security
			measures are defined, according to level.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler defines __STRICT_ANSI__.
   If none of these are defined, the default is to have _SVID_SOURCE,
   _BSD_SOURCE, and _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200112L.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.
   For example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE
   together give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_BSD		Define 4.3BSD things.
   __USE_SVID		Define SVID things.
   __USE_MISC		Define things common to BSD and System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_REENTRANT	Define reentrant/thread-safe *_r functions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.
   __FAVOR_BSD		Favor 4.3BSD things in cases of conflict.

   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.

/**
 * \defgroup CUDART CUDA Runtime API
 *
 * There are two levels for the runtime API.
 *
 * The C API (<i>cuda_runtime_api.h</i>) is
 * a C-style interface that does not require compiling with \p nvcc.
 *
 * The \ref CUDART_HIGHLEVEL "C++ API" (<i>cuda_runtime.h</i>) is a
 * C++-style interface built on top of the C API. It wraps some of the
 * C API routines, using overloading, references and default arguments.
 * These wrappers can be used from C++ code and can be compiled with any C++
 * compiler. The C++ API also has some CUDA-specific wrappers that wrap
 * C API routines that deal with symbols, textures, and device functions.
 * These wrappers require the use of \p nvcc because they depend on code being
 * generated by the compiler. For example, the execution configuration syntax
 * to invoke kernels is only available in source code compiled with \p nvcc.

 *
 * ::cudaMemcpy3DAsync() copies data betwen two 3D objects. The source and
 * destination objects may be in either host memory, device memory, or a CUDA
 * array. The source, destination, extent, and kind of copy performed is
 * specified by the ::cudaMemcpy3DParms struct which should be initialized to
 * zero before use:
\code
cudaMemcpy3DParms myParms = {0};
\endcode
 *
 * The struct passed to ::cudaMemcpy3DAsync() must specify one of \p srcArray
 * or \p srcPtr and one of \p dstArray or \p dstPtr. Passing more than one
 * non-zero source or destination will cause ::cudaMemcpy3DAsync() to return an
 * error.
 *
 * The \p srcPos and \p dstPos fields are optional offsets into the source and
 * destination objects and are defined in units of each object's elements. The
 * element for a host or device pointer is assumed to be <b>unsigned char</b>.
 * For CUDA arrays, positions must be in the range [0, 2048) for any
 * dimension.
 *
 * The \p extent field defines the dimensions of the transferred area in
 * elements. If a CUDA array is participating in the copy, the extent is
 * defined in terms of that array's elements. If no CUDA array is
 * participating in the copy then the extents are defined in elements of
 * <b>unsigned char</b>.
 *
 * The \p kind field defines the direction of the copy. It must be one of
 * ::cudaMemcpyHostToHost, ::cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, ::cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost,
 * or ::cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice.
 *
 * If the source and destination are both arrays, ::cudaMemcpy3DAsync() will
 * return an error if they do not have the same element size.
 *
 * The source and destination object may not overlap. If overlapping source
 * and destination objects are specified, undefined behavior will result.
 *
 * The source object must lie entirely within the region defined by \p srcPos
 * and \p extent. The destination object must lie entirely within the region
 * defined by \p dstPos and \p extent.
 *
 * ::cudaMemcpy3DAsync() returns an error if the pitch of \p srcPtr or
 * \p dstPtr exceeds the maximum allowed. The pitch of a
 * ::cudaPitchedPtr allocated with ::cudaMalloc3D() will always be valid.
 *
 * ::cudaMemcpy3DAsync() is asynchronous with respect to the host, so
 * the call may return before the copy is complete. It only works on
 * page-locked host memory and returns an error if a pointer to pageable
 * memory is passed as input. The copy can optionally be associated to a
 * stream by passing a non-zero \p stream argument. If \p kind is
 * ::cudaMemcpyHostToDevice or ::cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost and \p stream
 * is non-zero, the copy may overlap with operations in other streams.

 * Whether or not a device supports unified addressing may be 
 * queried by calling ::cudaGetDeviceProperties() with the device 
 * property ::cudaDeviceProp::unifiedAddressing.
 *
 * Unified addressing is automatically enabled in 64-bit processes 
 * on devices with compute capability greater than or equal to 2.0.
 *
 * Unified addressing is not yet supported on Windows Vista or
 * Windows 7 for devices that do not use the TCC driver model.
 *
 * \section CUDART_UNIFIED_lookup Looking Up Information from Pointer Values
 *
 * It is possible to look up information about the memory which backs a 
 * pointer value.  For instance, one may want to know if a pointer points
 * to host or device memory.  As another example, in the case of device 
 * memory, one may want to know on which CUDA device the memory 
 * resides.  These properties may be queried using the function 
 * ::cudaPointerGetAttributes()
 *
 * Because pointers are unique, it is not necessary to specify information
 * about the pointers specified to ::cudaMemcpy() and other copy functions.  
 * The copy direction ::cudaMemcpyDefault may be used to specify that the 
 * CUDA runtime should infer the location of the pointer from its value.
 *
 * \section CUDART_UNIFIED_automaphost Automatic Mapping of Host Allocated Host Memory
 *
 * All host memory allocated through all devices using ::cudaMallocHost() and
 * ::cudaHostAlloc() is always directly accessible from all devices that 
 * support unified addressing.  This is the case regardless of whether or 
 * not the flags ::cudaHostAllocPortable and ::cudaHostAllocMapped are 
 * specified.
 *
 * The pointer value through which allocated host memory may be accessed 
 * in kernels on all devices that support unified addressing is the same 
 * as the pointer value through which that memory is accessed on the host.
 * It is not necessary to call ::cudaHostGetDevicePointer() to get the device 
 * pointer for these allocations.  
 *
 * Note that this is not the case for memory allocated using the flag
 * ::cudaHostAllocWriteCombined, as discussed below.
 *
 * \section CUDART_UNIFIED_autopeerregister Direct Access of 
 *          Peer Memory
 
 * Upon enabling direct access from a device that supports unified addressing 
 * to another peer device that supports unified addressing using 
 * ::cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess() all memory allocated in the peer device using 
 * ::cudaMalloc() and ::cudaMallocPitch() will immediately be accessible 
 * by the current device.  The device pointer value through 
 * which any peer's memory may be accessed in the current device 
 * is the same pointer value through which that memory may be 
 * accessed from the peer device. 
 *
 * \section CUDART_UNIFIED_exceptions Exceptions, Disjoint Addressing
 * 
 * Not all memory may be accessed on devices through the same pointer
 * value through which they are accessed on the host.  These exceptions
 * are host memory registered using ::cudaHostRegister() and host memory
 * allocated using the flag ::cudaHostAllocWriteCombined.  For these 
 * exceptions, there exists a distinct host and device address for the
 * memory.  The device address is guaranteed to not overlap any valid host
 * pointer range and is guaranteed to have the same value across all devices
 * that support unified addressing.  
 * 
 * This device address may be queried using ::cudaHostGetDevicePointer() 
 * when a device using unified addressing is current.  Either the host 
 * or the unified device pointer value may be used to refer to this memory 
 * in ::cudaMemcpy() and similar functions using the ::cudaMemcpyDefault 
 * memory direction.

 * \defgroup CUDART_DRIVER Interactions with the CUDA Driver API
 * This section describes the interactions between the CUDA Driver API and the CUDA Runtime API
 *
 * \brief Interactions between the CUDA Driver API and the CUDA Runtime API.
 *
 * @{
 *
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_primary Primary Contexts
 *
 * There exists a one to one relationship between CUDA devices in the CUDA Runtime
 * API and ::CUcontext s in the CUDA Driver API within a process.  The specific
 * context which the CUDA Runtime API uses for a device is called the device's
 * primary context.  From the perspective of the CUDA Runtime API, a device and 
 * its primary context are synonymous.
 *
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_init Initialization and Tear-Down
 *
 * CUDA Runtime API calls operate on the CUDA Driver API ::CUcontext which is current to
 * to the calling host thread.  
 *
 * The function ::cudaSetDevice() makes the primary context for the
 * specified device current to the calling thread by calling ::cuCtxSetCurrent().
 *
 * The CUDA Runtime API will automatically initialize the primary context for
 * a device at the first CUDA Runtime API call which requires an active context.
 * If no ::CUcontext is current to the calling thread when a CUDA Runtime API call 
 * which requires an active context is made, then the primary context for a device 
 * will be selected, made current to the calling thread, and initialized.
 *
 * The context which the CUDA Runtime API initializes will be initialized using 
 * the parameters specified by the CUDA Runtime API functions
 * ::cudaSetDeviceFlags(), 
 * ::cudaD3D9SetDirect3DDevice(), 
 * ::cudaD3D10SetDirect3DDevice(), 
 * ::cudaD3D11SetDirect3DDevice(), 
 * ::cudaGLSetGLDevice(), and
 * ::cudaVDPAUSetVDPAUDevice().
 * Note that these functions will fail with ::cudaErrorSetOnActiveProcess if they are 
 * called when the primary context for the specified device has already been initialized.
 * (or if the current device has already been initialized, in the case of 
 * ::cudaSetDeviceFlags()). 
 *
 * Primary contexts will remain active until they are explicitly deinitialized 
 * using ::cudaDeviceReset().  The function ::cudaDeviceReset() will deinitialize the 
 * primary context for the calling thread's current device immediately.  The context 
 * will remain current to all of the threads that it was current to.  The next CUDA 
 * Runtime API call on any thread which requires an active context will trigger the 
 * reinitialization of that device's primary context.
 *
 * Note that there is no reference counting of the primary context's lifetime.  It is
 * recommended that the primary context not be deinitialized except just before exit
 * or to recover from an unspecified launch failure.
 * 
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_context Context Interoperability
 *
 * Note that the use of multiple ::CUcontext s per device within a single process 
 * will substantially degrade performance and is strongly discouraged.  Instead,
 * it is highly recommended that the implicit one-to-one device-to-context mapping
 * for the process provided by the CUDA Runtime API be used.
 *
 * If a non-primary ::CUcontext created by the CUDA Driver API is current to a
 * thread then the CUDA Runtime API calls to that thread will operate on that 
 * ::CUcontext, with some exceptions listed below.  Interoperability between data
 * types is discussed in the following sections.
 *
 * The function ::cudaPointerGetAttributes() will return the error 
 * ::cudaErrorIncompatibleDriverContext if the pointer being queried was allocated by a 
 * non-primary context.  The function ::cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess() and the rest of 
 * the peer access API may not be called when a non-primary ::CUcontext is current.  
 * To use the pointer query and peer access APIs with a context created using the 
 * CUDA Driver API, it is necessary that the CUDA Driver API be used to access
 * these features.
 *
 * All CUDA Runtime API state (e.g, global variables' addresses and values) travels
 * with its underlying ::CUcontext.  In particular, if a ::CUcontext is moved from one 
 * thread to another then all CUDA Runtime API state will move to that thread as well.
 *
 * Please note that attaching to legacy contexts (those with a version of 3010 as returned
 * by ::cuCtxGetApiVersion()) is not possible. The CUDA Runtime will return
 * ::cudaErrorIncompatibleDriverContext in such cases.
 *
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_stream Interactions between CUstream and cudaStream_t
 *
 * The types ::CUstream and ::cudaStream_t are identical and may be used interchangeably.
 *
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_event Interactions between CUevent and cudaEvent_t
 *
 * The types ::CUevent and ::cudaEvent_t are identical and may be used interchangeably.
 *
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_array Interactions between CUarray and struct cudaArray *
 *
 * The types ::CUarray and struct ::cudaArray * represent the same data type and may be used
 * interchangeably by casting the two types between each other.
 *
 * In order to use a ::CUarray in a CUDA Runtime API function which takes a struct ::cudaArray *,
 * it is necessary to explicitly cast the ::CUarray to a struct ::cudaArray *.
 *
 * In order to use a struct ::cudaArray * in a CUDA Driver API function which takes a ::CUarray,
 * it is necessary to explicitly cast the struct ::cudaArray * to a ::CUarray .
 *
 * \section CUDART_CUDA_graphicsResource Interactions between CUgraphicsResource and cudaGraphicsResource_t
 *
 * The types ::CUgraphicsResource and ::cudaGraphicsResource_t represent the same data type and may be used
 * interchangeably by casting the two types between each other.
 *
 * In order to use a ::CUgraphicsResource in a CUDA Runtime API function which takes a 
 * ::cudaGraphicsResource_t, it is necessary to explicitly cast the ::CUgraphicsResource 
 * to a ::cudaGraphicsResource_t.
 *
 * In order to use a ::cudaGraphicsResource_t in a CUDA Driver API function which takes a
 * ::CUgraphicsResource, it is necessary to explicitly cast the ::cudaGraphicsResource_t 
 * to a ::CUgraphicsResource.

   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)

	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,

// Allow use of the GNU syntax extension, "extern template." This
// extension is fully documented in the g++ manual, but in a nutshell,

// library to avoid multiple weak definitions for required types that
// are already explicitly instantiated in the library binary. This
// substantially reduces the binary size of resulting executables.




// Certain function definitions that are meant to be overridable from
// user code are decorated with this macro.  For some targets, this

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for

// This file provides some compile-time information about various types.
// These representations were designed, on purpose, to be constant-expressions
// and not types as found in <bits/type_traits.h>.  In particular, they
// can be used in control structures and the optimizer hopefully will do
// the obvious thing.
//
// Why integral expressions, and not functions nor types?
// Firstly, these compile-time entities are used as template-arguments
// so function return values won't work:  We need compile-time entities.
// We're left with types and constant  integral expressions.
// Secondly, from the point of view of ease of use, type-based compile-time
// information is -not- *that* convenient.  On has to write lots of
// overloaded functions and to hope that the compiler will select the right
// one. As a net effect, the overall structure isn't very clear at first
// glance.
// Thirdly, partial ordering and overload resolution (of function templates)
// is highly costly in terms of compiler-resource.  It is a Good Thing to

/**
 * \brief \hl Allocates page-locked memory on the host
 *
 * Allocates \p size bytes of host memory that is page-locked and accessible
 * to the device. The driver tracks the virtual memory ranges allocated with
 * this function and automatically accelerates calls to functions such as
 * ::cudaMemcpy(). Since the memory can be accessed directly by the device, it
 * can be read or written with much higher bandwidth than pageable memory
 * obtained with functions such as ::malloc(). Allocating excessive amounts of
 * pinned memory may degrade system performance, since it reduces the amount
 * of memory available to the system for paging. As a result, this function is
 * best used sparingly to allocate staging areas for data exchange between host
 * and device.
 *
 * The \p flags parameter enables different options to be specified that affect
 * the allocation, as follows.
 * - ::cudaHostAllocDefault: This flag's value is defined to be 0.
 * - ::cudaHostAllocPortable: The memory returned by this call will be
 * considered as pinned memory by all CUDA contexts, not just the one that
 * performed the allocation.
 * - ::cudaHostAllocMapped: Maps the allocation into the CUDA address space.
 * The device pointer to the memory may be obtained by calling
 * ::cudaHostGetDevicePointer().
 * - ::cudaHostAllocWriteCombined: Allocates the memory as write-combined (WC).
 * WC memory can be transferred across the PCI Express bus more quickly on some
 * system configurations, but cannot be read efficiently by most CPUs.  WC
 * memory is a good option for buffers that will be written by the CPU and read
 * by the device via mapped pinned memory or host->device transfers.
 *
 * All of these flags are orthogonal to one another: a developer may allocate
 * memory that is portable, mapped and/or write-combined with no restrictions.
 *
 * ::cudaSetDeviceFlags() must have been called with the ::cudaDeviceMapHost
 * flag in order for the ::cudaHostAllocMapped flag to have any effect.
 *
 * The ::cudaHostAllocMapped flag may be specified on CUDA contexts for devices
 * that do not support mapped pinned memory. The failure is deferred to
 * ::cudaHostGetDevicePointer() because the memory may be mapped into other
 * CUDA contexts via the ::cudaHostAllocPortable flag.
 *
 * Memory allocated by this function must be freed with ::cudaFreeHost().
 *
 * \param ptr   - Device pointer to allocated memory
 * \param size  - Requested allocation size in bytes
 * \param flags - Requested properties of allocated memory
 *
 * \return
 * ::cudaSuccess,
 * ::cudaErrorMemoryAllocation

/**
 * \brief Create a CUDA context
 *
 * Creates a new CUDA context and associates it with the calling thread. The
 * \p flags parameter is described below. The context is created with a usage
 * count of 1 and the caller of ::cuCtxCreate() must call ::cuCtxDestroy() or
 * when done using the context. If a context is already current to the thread, 
 * it is supplanted by the newly created context and may be restored by a subsequent 
 * call to ::cuCtxPopCurrent().
 *
 * The three LSBs of the \p flags parameter can be used to control how the OS
 * thread, which owns the CUDA context at the time of an API call, interacts
 * with the OS scheduler when waiting for results from the GPU. Only one of
 * the scheduling flags can be set when creating a context.
 *
 * - ::CU_CTX_SCHED_AUTO: The default value if the \p flags parameter is zero,
 * uses a heuristic based on the number of active CUDA contexts in the
 * process \e C and the number of logical processors in the system \e P. If
 * \e C > \e P, then CUDA will yield to other OS threads when waiting for
 * the GPU, otherwise CUDA will not yield while waiting for results and
 * actively spin on the processor.
 *
 * - ::CU_CTX_SCHED_SPIN: Instruct CUDA to actively spin when waiting for
 * results from the GPU. This can decrease latency when waiting for the GPU,
 * but may lower the performance of CPU threads if they are performing work in
 * parallel with the CUDA thread.
 *
 * - ::CU_CTX_SCHED_YIELD: Instruct CUDA to yield its thread when waiting for
 * results from the GPU. This can increase latency when waiting for the GPU,
 * but can increase the performance of CPU threads performing work in parallel
 * with the GPU.
 * 
 * - ::CU_CTX_SCHED_BLOCKING_SYNC: Instruct CUDA to block the CPU thread on a
 * synchronization primitive when waiting for the GPU to finish work.
 *
 * - ::CU_CTX_BLOCKING_SYNC: Instruct CUDA to block the CPU thread on a
 * synchronization primitive when waiting for the GPU to finish work.
 * \deprecated This flag was deprecated as of CUDA 4.0 and was replaced 
 * with ::CU_CTX_SCHED_BLOCKING_SYNC. 
 *
 * - ::CU_CTX_MAP_HOST: Instruct CUDA to support mapped pinned allocations.
 * This flag must be set in order to allocate pinned host memory that is
 * accessible to the GPU.
 *
 * - ::CU_CTX_LMEM_RESIZE_TO_MAX: Instruct CUDA to not reduce local memory
 * after resizing local memory for a kernel. This can prevent thrashing by
 * local memory allocations when launching many kernels with high local
 * memory usage at the cost of potentially increased memory usage.
 *
 * Context creation will fail with ::CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN if the compute mode of
 * the device is ::CU_COMPUTEMODE_PROHIBITED. Similarly, context creation will
 * also fail with ::CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN if the compute mode for the device is
 * set to ::CU_COMPUTEMODE_EXCLUSIVE and there is already an active context on
 * the device. The function ::cuDeviceGetAttribute() can be used with
 * ::CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPUTE_MODE to determine the compute mode of the
 * device. The <i>nvidia-smi</i> tool can be used to set the compute mode for
 * devices. Documentation for <i>nvidia-smi</i> can be obtained by passing a

 * best used sparingly to allocate staging areas for data exchange between
 * host and device.
 *
 * The \p Flags parameter enables different options to be specified that
 * affect the allocation, as follows.
 *
 * - ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_PORTABLE: The memory returned by this call will be
 *   considered as pinned memory by all CUDA contexts, not just the one that
 *   performed the allocation.
 *
 * - ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_DEVICEMAP: Maps the allocation into the CUDA address
 *   space. The device pointer to the memory may be obtained by calling
 *   ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer(). This feature is available only on GPUs
 *   with compute capability greater than or equal to 1.1.
 *
 * - ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED: Allocates the memory as write-combined
 *   (WC). WC memory can be transferred across the PCI Express bus more
 *   quickly on some system configurations, but cannot be read efficiently by
 *   most CPUs. WC memory is a good option for buffers that will be written by
 *   the CPU and read by the GPU via mapped pinned memory or host->device
 *   transfers.
 *
 * All of these flags are orthogonal to one another: a developer may allocate
 * memory that is portable, mapped and/or write-combined with no restrictions.
 *
 * The CUDA context must have been created with the ::CU_CTX_MAP_HOST flag in
 * order for the ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_MAPPED flag to have any effect.
 *
 * The ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_MAPPED flag may be specified on CUDA contexts for
 * devices that do not support mapped pinned memory. The failure is deferred
 * to ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer() because the memory may be mapped into
 * other CUDA contexts via the ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_PORTABLE flag.
 *
 * The memory allocated by this function must be freed with ::cuMemFreeHost().
 *
 * Note all host memory allocated using ::cuMemHostAlloc() will automatically
 * be immediately accessible to all contexts on all devices which support unified
 * addressing (as may be queried using ::CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_UNIFIED_ADDRESSING).
 * Unless the flag ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED is specified, the device pointer 
 * that may be used to access this host memory from those contexts is always equal 
 * to the returned host pointer \p *pp.  If the flag ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED
 * is specified, then the function ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer() must be used
 * to query the device pointer, even if the context supports unified addressing.

 * \brief Registers an existing host memory range for use by CUDA

 * to the same tracking mechanism as ::cuMemHostAlloc to automatically accelerate
 * calls to functions such as ::cuMemcpyHtoD(). Since the memory can be accessed 
 * directly by the device, it can be read or written with much higher bandwidth 
 * than pageable memory that has not been registered.  Page-locking excessive
 * amounts of memory may degrade system performance, since it reduces the amount
 * of memory available to the system for paging. As a result, this function is
 * best used sparingly to register staging areas for data exchange between
 * host and device.
 *
 * This function is not yet supported on Mac OS X.
 *
 * The \p Flags parameter enables different options to be specified that
 * affect the allocation, as follows.
 *
 * - ::CU_MEMHOSTREGISTER_PORTABLE: The memory returned by this call will be
 *   considered as pinned memory by all CUDA contexts, not just the one that
 *   performed the allocation.
 *
 * - ::CU_MEMHOSTREGISTER_DEVICEMAP: Maps the allocation into the CUDA address
 *   space. The device pointer to the memory may be obtained by calling
 *   ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer(). This feature is available only on GPUs
 *   with compute capability greater than or equal to 1.1.
 *
 * All of these flags are orthogonal to one another: a developer may page-lock
 * memory that is portable or mapped with no restrictions.
 *
 * The CUDA context must have been created with the ::CU_CTX_MAP_HOST flag in
 * order for the ::CU_MEMHOSTREGISTER_DEVICEMAP flag to have any effect.
 *
 * The ::CU_MEMHOSTREGISTER_DEVICEMAP flag may be specified on CUDA contexts for
 * devices that do not support mapped pinned memory. The failure is deferred
 * to ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer() because the memory may be mapped into
 * other CUDA contexts via the ::CU_MEMHOSTREGISTER_PORTABLE flag.
 *
 * The pointer \p p and size \p bytesize must be aligned to the host page

/**
 * \defgroup CUDA_UNIFIED Unified Addressing
 *
 * This section describes the unified addressing functions of the 
 * low-level CUDA driver application programming interface.
 *
 * @{
 *
 * \section CUDA_UNIFIED_overview Overview
 *
 * CUDA devices can share a unified address space with the host.  
 * For these devices there is no distinction between a device
 * pointer and a host pointer -- the same pointer value may be 
 * used to access memory from the host program and from a kernel 
 * running on the device (with exceptions enumerated below).
 *
 * \section CUDA_UNIFIED_support Supported Platforms
 * 
 * Whether or not a device supports unified addressing may be 
 * queried by calling ::cuDeviceGetAttribute() with the device 
 * attribute ::CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_UNIFIED_ADDRESSING.
 *
 * Unified addressing is automatically enabled in 64-bit processes 
 * on devices with compute capability greater than or equal to 2.0.
 *
 * Unified addressing is not yet supported on Windows Vista or
 * Windows 7 for devices that do not use the TCC driver model.
 *
 * \section CUDA_UNIFIED_lookup Looking Up Information from Pointer Values
 *
 * It is possible to look up information about the memory which backs a 
 * pointer value.  For instance, one may want to know if a pointer points
 * to host or device memory.  As another example, in the case of device 
 * memory, one may want to know on which CUDA device the memory 
 * resides.  These properties may be queried using the function 
 * ::cuPointerGetAttribute()
 *
 * Because pointers are unique, it is not necessary to specify information
 * about the pointers specified to the various copy functions in the 
 * CUDA API.  The function ::cuMemcpy() may be used to perform a copy
 * between two pointers, ignoring whether they point to host or device
 * memory (making ::cuMemcpyHtoD(), ::cuMemcpyDtoD(), and ::cuMemcpyDtoH()
 * unnecessary for devices supporting unified addressing).  For 
 * multidimensional copies, the memory type ::CU_MEMORYTYPE_UNIFIED may be
 * used to specify that the CUDA driver should infer the location of the
 * pointer from its value.
 *
 * \section CUDA_UNIFIED_automaphost Automatic Mapping of Host Allocated Host Memory
 *
 * All host memory allocated in all contexts using ::cuMemAllocHost() and
 * ::cuMemHostAlloc() is always directly accessible from all contexts on
 * all devices that support unified addressing.  This is the case regardless 
 * of whether or not the flags ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_PORTABLE and
 * ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_DEVICEMAP are specified.
 *
 * The pointer value through which allocated host memory may be accessed 
 * in kernels on all devices that support unified addressing is the same 
 * as the pointer value through which that memory is accessed on the host,
 * so it is not necessary to call ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer() to get the device 
 * pointer for these allocations.
 * 
 * Note that this is not the case for memory allocated using the flag
 * ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED, as discussed below.
 *
 * \section CUDA_UNIFIED_autopeerregister Automatic Registration of Peer Memory
 *
 * Upon enabling direct access from a context that supports unified addressing 
 * to another peer context that supports unified addressing using 
 * ::cuCtxEnablePeerAccess() all memory allocated in the peer context using 
 * ::cuMemAlloc() and ::cuMemAllocPitch() will immediately be accessible 
 * by the current context.  The device pointer value through
 * which any peer memory may be accessed in the current context
 * is the same pointer value through which that memory may be
 * accessed in the peer context.
 *
 * \section CUDA_UNIFIED_exceptions Exceptions, Disjoint Addressing
 * 
 * Not all memory may be accessed on devices through the same pointer
 * value through which they are accessed on the host.  These exceptions
 * are host memory registered using ::cuMemHostRegister() and host memory
 * allocated using the flag ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED.  For these 
 * exceptions, there exists a distinct host and device address for the
 * memory.  The device address is guaranteed to not overlap any valid host
 * pointer range and is guaranteed to have the same value across all 
 * contexts that support unified addressing.  
 * 
 * This device address may be queried using ::cuMemHostGetDevicePointer() 
 * when a context using unified addressing is current.  Either the host 
 * or the unified device pointer value may be used to refer to this memory 
 * through ::cuMemcpy() and similar functions using the 
 * ::CU_MEMORYTYPE_UNIFIED memory type.
 *

 * \brief Returns information about a pointer

 * The supported attributes are:
 * 
 * - ::CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONTEXT: 
 * 
 *      Returns in \p *data the ::CUcontext in which \p ptr was allocated or 
 *      registered.   
 *      The type of \p data must be ::CUcontext *.  
 *      
 *      If \p ptr was not allocated by, mapped by, or registered with
 *      a ::CUcontext which uses unified virtual addressing then 
 *      ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE is returned.
 * 
 * - ::CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_MEMORY_TYPE: 
 *    
 *      Returns in \p *data the physical memory type of the memory that 
 *      \p ptr addresses as a ::CUmemorytype enumerated value.
 *      The type of \p data must be unsigned int.
 *      
 *      If \p ptr addresses device memory then \p *data is set to 
 *      ::CU_MEMORYTYPE_DEVICE.  The particular ::CUdevice on which the 
 *      memory resides is the ::CUdevice of the ::CUcontext returned by the 
 *      ::CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONTEXT attribute of \p ptr.
 *      
 *      If \p ptr addresses host memory then \p *data is set to 
 *      ::CU_MEMORYTYPE_HOST.
 *      
 *      If \p ptr was not allocated by, mapped by, or registered with
 *      a ::CUcontext which uses unified virtual addressing then 
 *      ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE is returned.
 *
 *      If the current ::CUcontext does not support unified virtual 
 *      addressing then ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT is returned.
 *    
 * - ::CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_DEVICE_POINTER:
 * 
 *      Returns in \p *data the device pointer value through which
 *      \p ptr may be accessed by kernels running in the current 
 *      ::CUcontext.
 *      The type of \p data must be CUdeviceptr *.
 * 
 *      If there exists no device pointer value through which
 *      kernels running in the current ::CUcontext may access
 *      \p ptr then ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE is returned.
 * 
 *      If there is no current ::CUcontext then 
 *      ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT is returned.
 *      
 *      Except in the exceptional disjoint addressing cases discussed 
 *      below, the value returned in \p *data will equal the input 
 *      value \p ptr.
 * 
 * - ::CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_POINTER:
 * 
 *      Returns in \p *data the host pointer value through which 
 *      \p ptr may be accessed by by the host program.
 *      The type of \p data must be void **.
 *      If there exists no host pointer value through which
 *      the host program may directly access \p ptr then 
 *      ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE is returned.
 * 
 *      Except in the exceptional disjoint addressing cases discussed 
 *      below, the value returned in \p *data will equal the input 
 *      value \p ptr.
 * 
 *
 * \par
 *
 * Note that for most allocations in the unified virtual address space
 * the host and device pointer for accessing the allocation will be the 
 * same.  The exceptions to this are
 *  - user memory registered using ::cuMemHostRegister 
 *  - host memory allocated using ::cuMemHostAlloc with the 
 *    ::CU_MEMHOSTALLOC_WRITECOMBINED flag
 * For these types of allocation there will exist separate, disjoint host 
 * and device addresses for accessing the allocation.  In particular 
 *  - The host address will correspond to an invalid unmapped device address 
 *    (which will result in an exception if accessed from the device) 
 *  - The device address will correspond to an invalid unmapped host address 
 *    (which will result in an exception if accessed from the host).
 * For these types of allocations, querying ::CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_POINTER

/**
 * \brief Launches a CUDA function
 *
 * Invokes the kernel \p f on a \p gridDimX x \p gridDimY x \p gridDimZ
 * grid of blocks. Each block contains \p blockDimX x \p blockDimY x
 * \p blockDimZ threads.
 *
 * \p sharedMemBytes sets the amount of dynamic shared memory that will be
 * available to each thread block.
 *
 * ::cuLaunchKernel() can optionally be associated to a stream by passing a
 * non-zero \p hStream argument.
 *
 * Kernel parameters to \p f can be specified in one of two ways:
 *
 * 1) Kernel parameters can be specified via \p kernelParams.  If \p f
 * has N parameters, then \p kernelParams needs to be an array of N
 * pointers.  Each of \p kernelParams[0] through \p kernelParams[N-1]
 * must point to a region of memory from which the actual kernel
 * parameter will be copied.  The number of kernel parameters and their
 * offsets and sizes do not need to be specified as that information is
 * retrieved directly from the kernel's image.
 *
 * 2) Kernel parameters can also be packaged by the application into
 * a single buffer that is passed in via the \p extra parameter.
 * This places the burden on the application of knowing each kernel
 * parameter's size and alignment/padding within the buffer.  Here is
 * an example of using the \p extra parameter in this manner:
 * \code
    size_t argBufferSize;
    char argBuffer[256];

    // populate argBuffer and argBufferSize

    void *config[] = {
        CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER, argBuffer,
        CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_SIZE,    &argBufferSize,
        CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END
    };
    status = cuLaunchKernel(f, gx, gy, gz, bx, by, bz, sh, s, NULL, config);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The \p extra parameter exists to allow ::cuLaunchKernel to take
 * additional less commonly used arguments.  \p extra specifies a list of
 * names of extra settings and their corresponding values.  Each extra
 * setting name is immediately followed by the corresponding value.  The
 * list must be terminated with either NULL or ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END.
 *
 * - ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_END, which indicates the end of the \p extra
 *   array;
 * - ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER, which specifies that the next
 *   value in \p extra will be a pointer to a buffer containing all
 *   the kernel parameters for launching kernel \p f;
 * - ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_SIZE, which specifies that the next
 *   value in \p extra will be a pointer to a size_t containing the
 *   size of the buffer specified with ::CU_LAUNCH_PARAM_BUFFER_POINTER;
 *
 * The error ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE will be returned if kernel
 * parameters are specified with both \p kernelParams and \p extra
 * (i.e. both \p kernelParams and \p extra are non-NULL).
 *
 * Calling ::cuLaunchKernel() sets persistent function state that is
 * the same as function state set through the following deprecated APIs:
 *
 *  ::cuFuncSetBlockShape()
 *  ::cuFuncSetSharedSize()
 *  ::cuParamSetSize()
 *  ::cuParamSeti()
 *  ::cuParamSetf()
 *  ::cuParamSetv()
 *
 * When the kernel \p f is launched via ::cuLaunchKernel(), the previous
 * block shape, shared size and parameter info associated with \p f
 * is overwritten.
 *
 * Note that to use ::cuLaunchKernel(), the kernel \p f must either have
 * been compiled with toolchain version 3.2 or later so that it will
 * contain kernel parameter information, or have no kernel parameters.
 * If either of these conditions is not met, then ::cuLaunchKernel() will
 * return ::CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE.
